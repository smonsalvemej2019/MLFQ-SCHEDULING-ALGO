# MLFQ-SCHEDULING-ALGO
<h4>Simulation of the multi-level feedback queue scheduling algorithm</h4>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>The Multi level feedback queue is based on the code used for the first come first serve algorithm simulation. This time around I applied more object oriented programing concepts like static methods and member variables as well as better pointer manager; This simulation does not have as many node types except for some temp nodes and a setup node at the beginning of the program</p>
